# Experimenting with Flutter
A project for learning Flutter.
I'll put this project on hold now and I am coming back to React/TypeScript/MUI to experiment with a local project React Client for Service Broker.
I commited this statement on January 19, and a couple of days ago I reopened the project to go on with experimenting with Flutter. I am maintaining an accompanying document file on my private onedrive: FlutterGettingStarted.
This repository has a number of branches. Each sample is saved in a separate branch.
The master branch is practically empty, it has only a README.md, a basic .gitignore and a LICENSE file. This is perfectly fine for Visual Studio Code, Android Studio maintains a bunch of workspace and project files.
So, to create a new project, first create a new branch then use the usual 
`flutter create .` where the dot is the current directory, as documented on the [Flutter Test Drive page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal)
With this commit I upgraded the default gitignore with the [gitignore available on the GitHub page of Flutter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/flutter/master/.gitignore), so you don't be worried, hopefully, about gitignore. 
Fortunately, the command line command flutter create accepts this enhanced gitignore file.
So, remember to create a new branch from master before running flutter create.

The first branch was `hitesh01`, check out that branch.
Now I am creating a `helloworld` branch for the most basic app explained on [flutter.dev/docs/development/ui Introduction to widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)

## [Flutter Architecture Samples](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples)
The most important Flutter saple set is Brian Egan's sample set especially the [Vanilla](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/example/vanilla) is brilliant. 
In this example he mentiones that he brough the concepts from React's [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) as well as Thinking in React, which my favorite, too.

## Real or False Issues with Flutter?
A couple of young developer guys after three days of evaluating Flutter, collected their major concers and dropped the language and tool completely.
- No private and protected visibility, only public and package.
- No interface keyword
- No runtime reflection to get annotation info
- Very little help on stackoverflow
- Asynchronous programming is nightmare
- No traditional lifecycle management for UI
- Packages are under heavy development, no stable API  

I wouldn't say all of these are nonsense, still some has truth in it. Honestly I can only agree with the comment about runtime reflection. Dart has no finalizers, nor destructors either, which is really a pain.
Android Java VM's and iOS/Swift real preemptive multithreading both definitely are far superior than Dart's, but millions of programmers are working with JavaScript/TypeScript and Dart has exactly the same event loop-based Future/Promise machinery for asynchronous programming, since the underlying packages for HTTP communications, behind the scene use real multi-threading. Definitely, neither in JavaScript nor in Dart you cannot implement complexlengthy computations, but libraries like Axios/JavaScript and http/Dart work excellently for asynchronous communication.
Flutter is one of the best documented new language with hundreds of excellent training videos, tutorials on Youtube, Udemy, Medium, Flutter.dev.
