# experimentingwithflutter
A project for experimenting with Flutter.
I'll put this project on hold now and I am coming back to React/TypeScript/MUI to experiment with a local project React Client for Service Broker.

## [Flutter Architecture Samples](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples)
The most important Flutter saple set is Brian Egan's sample set especially the [Vanilla](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/example/vanilla) is brilliant. 
In this example he mentiones that he brough the concepts from React's [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) as well as Thinking in React, which my favorite, too.
