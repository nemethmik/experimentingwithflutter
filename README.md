# Experimenting with Flutter

I am maintaining an accompanying document file on my private onedrive: FlutterGettingStarted.
Originally I created separate branches for the samples.
The first branch was `hitesh01`, check out that branch.
Then I made a `helloworld` branch for the most basic app explained on [flutter.dev/docs/development/ui Introduction to widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)

On 20190815 I started making subdirectories for the samples.

The first project in this series is **provider_counter**, which is actually a copy from [flutter/samples/provider_counter](https://github.com/flutter/samples/blob/master/provider_counter/lib/main.dart). I simply created a new project with the command `Flutter: New Project` in VSC. 

The other project was **b1tensorbloc** based on one of the brilliant youtube videos from Tensor Programming. I used here B1 SL, however to make the experiment relevant.

The project **provider_arc**
was for experimenting with Provider 3.0 ProxyProvider.
The project is based on 
[FilledStacks youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgrK_LlQRJ4&t=1s) 
and [initial project](https://github.com/FilledStacks/flutter-tutorials/tree/master/014-provider-v3-updates)

The project **nav_service** was from FilledStacks [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopdISefbJc) and corresponding sample repository. I have added **WillPopScope** widget to prevent back-navigation without logout.

## [Flutter Architecture Samples](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples)
The most important Flutter saple set is Brian Egan's sample set especially the [Vanilla](https://github.com/brianegan/flutter_architecture_samples/tree/master/example/vanilla) is brilliant. 
In this example he mentiones that he brough the concepts from React's [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) as well as Thinking in React, which my favorite, too.
