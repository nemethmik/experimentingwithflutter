# nav_service

FilledStacks' [experimental solution](https://github.com/FilledStacks/flutter-tutorials/tree/master/025-navigation-service) to use navigation in his view model (change notifier). As he explained in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopdISefbJc)

I'll add a feature to prevent back-navigation from the home screen without logging out.
